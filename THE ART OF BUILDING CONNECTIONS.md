THE ART OF BUILDING CONNECTIONS

Along with personal connections, there is a need to make professional connections. In today’s era where we are struggling to catch up with the ever-evolving technologies, an easy way in which we can move a step ahead from others is building professional connections. 

WHY IS THERE A NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS?
•	Gain knowledge: We can find extensive knowledge about various topics on the internet but only an experienced person working in that field can help us learn and understand the core of that subject. 
•	Boost communication skills: One needs to know how to put forth his/her opinions and ideas to get recognition for their work. Building connections, interacting with experts and professionals can help us understand the body language and way of speaking of a professional. 
•	Access to opportunities: Making connections helps you get insight of all the activities going on in the market that aren’t advertised publicly. 
•	Keeping up with industry trends: Staying in touch with your connections keeps you updated with the various trends in the industry. 
•	Guidance: The most helpful part of building connections is that you will find good mentors and it can be really helpful to build your career.

HOW TO BUILD CONNECTIONS?
•	Social platforms: Use platforms like LinkedIn, X(Twitter), GitHub, Quora, etc. to find people in the field of your interest online. You can also go to meetups that take place in your areas. 
•	Having conversations: You can go to your classmates, colleagues or teachers to ask doubts or simply have a conversation.
•	Be curious: Be ready to learn from each and every opportunity that comes your way. Being curious will pave a way to your journey towards knowledge. You will also find people who are interested in the same subject as you and hence you will find new acquaintances. 
•	Stay in touch: Check in with your contacts by sharing with them relevant news, asking for feedbacks and congratulating them on achievements. 

By staying consistent and patient you can create a reliable professional network to enhance both your personal and career journey.
