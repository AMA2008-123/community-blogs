What is Roadmap ?
Roadmap is a series of steps that helps you to achieve the desired output .

Need for Roadmap
It enables you to know how to attain a desired outcome without losing focus from your goal.

It enables you to get:

1. Clarity over the Big Picture
A roadmap provides a sense of direction on what you want and how to get there. This is much like knowing where you are going and what the stops along the way will be.

2. Helps not to get Distracted
Roadmap helps you to stay focussed and not get distracted. It will keep you on track and tell you a path to follow.

3. Motivation to Keep Going
What often feels overwhelming about large goals is just how fragmented they feel. But with a roadmap, those big goals can be broken down into something manageable. When each milestone is hit, it gives you that feeling of confidence and proves that true progress is being made, which makes it much easier to keep on going.

4. Flexibility for When Life Happens
A roadmap is not a concrete thing; it can be changed along with the changing situations. It is like a guide that keeps moving you ahead but gives you the freedom to take a detour when you need it.

5. Better Decisions on the Way
A roadmap makes decisions much easier; it helps you understand what constitutes something that aligns with your goal and what doesn't. It's like having a friend who helps you say "yes" to the right things and "no" to distractions.

6. Progress tracking and success measurement
A roadmap gives you the view of where you started, where you are, and how close you are to the finish. You stay motivated-not only by tracking your progress but also by celebrating how far you have traveled.
